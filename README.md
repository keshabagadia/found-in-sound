# Found in Sound

A simple Unity prototype about **unlocking phonemes** through word-building.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Build words using limited consonants and free vowels.  
- Each valid word must contain at least one **new phoneme** to progress.  
- Reusing the same phoneme reduces your score.  
- Unlock all phonemes to complete the game.  

## 🎯 Educational Goal
- Encourage players to **sound out phonemes** while forming words.  
- Highlight how different phonemes can appear across familiar words.  
- Promote connections between words that share similar sounds.  

## 🛠️ Current State
- Prototype with basic UI.  
- Some bugs (extra phonemes, unclear feedback for repeated ones).  
- Features under development: audio cues, drag-and-drop typing, score system, and high score tracking.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repo.  
2. Open the project in [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).  
3. Use the Unity editor (version XX.XX — *replace with your Unity version*) to run the game.  

## 📝 Next Steps
- Improve UI feedback when phonemes are reused.  
- Add audio cues for each unlocked phoneme.  
- Clean up word list (remove proper nouns/apostrophes).  
- Implement bonus wild consonants.  
- Add Game Over and high score conditions.

*This is an experimental prototype made to test gameplay around phoneme discovery and word construction.*
